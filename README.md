### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use computers to learn how plant genomes tick.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pangenomic, genomic selection, models of gene birth and death in Brassicaceae, and the applications of machine learning in selection.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything computational that you might need help with, as long as there's an interesting biological story attached! Machine learning, large scale (pan)genomics, genome-wide association studies, haplotype calling, genome assembly, annotation, I've done a bit
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: twitter.com/philippbayer is probably fastest. if not, my uni email which is philippDOTbayerATuwaDOTeduDOTau
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: most crops we rely on (bread wheat, canola, coffee, cotton, strawberry, etc.) are allopolyploids, that means that their cells contain a bunch of genomes from two or more ancestral species (canola: 2 genomes, bread wheat: 3 genomes). We humans have only one genome, *boring*
