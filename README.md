### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I use computers to learn how genomes work.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on interpretable ML around environmental DNA (eDNA) from  Western Australia's oceans. Hopefully soon I will have models which tell me which WA ocean areas are healthy, which areas show more diversity than expected, and which ones need help!
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm always happy to chat *anything* interpretable ML, especially applied to sequencing data (genomes/reads)!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://genomic.social/@philippbayer is probably fastest. if not, my Minderoo email is pbayerATminderooDOTorg
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ’¬ I regularly blog at https://philippbayer.github.io/blerg/
- âš¡ Fun fact: most crops we rely on (bread wheat, canola, coffee, cotton, strawberry, etc.) are allopolyploids, that means that their cells contain a bunch of genomes from two or more ancestral species (canola: 2 genomes, bread wheat: 3 genomes). We humans have only one genome, *boring*.
